This is a read-me from watiching Scope and Access Modifiers videos 

Scope of a script is usually definded by the curley braces that are placed for a class or a function.  In the video he showed an exaple of variable in scope of the class, and others 
only in scope of a specific function.  So whatever is inside the curley braces for that class fuction or other int is in the scope of that specific object. With the access modifiers of 
public and private are key words placed before a class or varialbe to tell us (the computer) where that variable can be seen and accessed from. A good rule to follow is if a variable doesn't need
to be public don't make it that way. A public variable can be overridden at any time from anywhere. Making the majority better off as private.
