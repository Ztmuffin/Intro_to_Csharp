This is a read-me from watiching Classes

classes are like a container for everything inside. Things like functions, other classes, and ints. It is important to remember that the first class has the same name as the
script title. So it is good to make a habit of not changing a class unless it is absolutely needed. Classes are easier to manage and easier to read if we spit them by tasks.
For example one class for this thing, another for a different one, etc. In classes we can create instances of objects, run functions, etc.  One of the biggest reasons we have classes
is to stay organized. Nobody wants to be filtering through a gigantic script to figure out what the want to change or to find an error.
